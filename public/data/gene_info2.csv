AT1G48410,https://www.arabidopsis.org//locus?key=26776,Other Names: AGO1;ARGONAUTE 1;ATAGO1;ICU9,"Encodes an RNA Slicer that selectively recruits microRNAs and siRNAs.  There is currently no evidence that AGO1 Slicer is in a high molecular weight RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Mutants are defective in post-transcriptional gene silencing and have pleiotropic developmental and morphological defects. Through its action on the  regulation of ARF17 expression, the protein regulates genes involved at the cross talk between auxin and light signaling during adventitious root development. AGO1 seems to be targeted for degradation by silencing suppressor F-box-containing proteins from Turnip yellow virus and Cucurbit aphid-borne yellow virus."

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter. It is a novel virulence target of the P. syringae type III secreted effector HopZ2."

The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.

Transcriptional activity of ABI3 requires the B3 DNA-binding domain and an activation domain. In addition to the known N-terminal-located activation domain, a second transcription activation domain was found in the B1 region of ABI3. ABI3 is essential for seed maturation. Regulator of the transition between embryo maturation and early seedling development. Putative seed-specific transcriptional activator. ABI3 is a central regulator in ABA signaling and is unstable in vivo.  It interacts with and can by polyubiquitinated by AIP2 in vivo. Based on double mutant analyses, ABI3 interacts genetically with both FUS3 and LEC1 and is involved in controlling accumulation of chlorophyll and anthocyanins, sensitivity to abscisic acid, and expression of the members of the 12S storage protein gene family. In addition, both FUS3 and LEC1 regulate positively the abundance of the ABI3 protein in the seed.  Alternative splicing of ABI3 is developmentally regulated by SUA (AT3G54230)."
